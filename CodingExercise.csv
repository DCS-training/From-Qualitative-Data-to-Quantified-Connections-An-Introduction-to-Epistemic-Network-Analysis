1,Anna,"I feel like some students aren’t engaging with the new activities, and I’m not sure why.",,,,
2,Basim,I noticed that too. Some of them said the instructions were a bit confusing.,,,,
3,Chloe,It might also be that the activities don’t reflect what they actually care about.,,,,
4,Dylan,We could ask them directly what topics they’d be interested in exploring.,,,,
5,Anna,"Yes, but I worry they won’t tell us honestly unless they feel safe to speak up.",,,,
6,Basim,Maybe we should run an anonymous survey so they can share their thoughts freely.,,,,
7,Chloe,"Surveys are good, but sometimes students want someone to really listen, not just tick boxes.",,,,
8,Dylan,"True, but we need something scalable. We can’t interview everyone one by one.",,,,
9,Anna,"Maybe a mix of both? A survey first, then small group chats with volunteers.",,,,
10,Basim,I like that. And we should also reflect on our materials—they’re a bit text-heavy.,,,,
11,Chloe,That’s a bigger issue. The whole programme leans too much on reading instead of doing.,,,,
12,Dylan,We could redesign one session as a hands-on experiment and see how it goes.,,,,
13,Anna,"And we should track how students respond to it, not just assume it works.",,,,
14,Basim,Agreed. We could collect engagement data throughout the session.,,,,
15,Chloe,"Engagement is important, but so is making sure students feel the content speaks to their experiences.",,,,
16,Dylan,"But if we customise too much, we risk losing the core learning objectives.",,,,
17,Anna,Maybe the real issue is finding balance between structure and flexibility.,,,,
18,Basim,"Yes, and we need to decide what success actually looks like for this programme.",,,,
19,Chloe,"Success should include students feeling empowered, not just checking off outcomes.",,,,
20,Dylan,"Alright, then let's draft a plan that combines student voice with our teaching goals.",,,,

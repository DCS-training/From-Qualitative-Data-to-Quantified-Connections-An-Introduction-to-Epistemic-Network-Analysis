From Qualitative Data to Quantified Connections: An Introduction to Epistemic Network Analysis
Overview

This repository contains the materials and datasets used in the workshop “From Qualitative Data to Quantified Connections: An Introduction to Epistemic Network Analysis (ENA)”, designed to introduce researchers and educators to the principles and practice of ENA. The workshop demonstrates how qualitative discourse can be systematically coded, modelled, and visualised as a network to reveal patterns of connection in meaning and reasoning.

**Contents**

GOT.scripts.code.exerciseS1ep1to3.csv	Training dataset containing raw dialogue segments from Game of Thrones, Season 1 Episodes 1–3. This file is used for participants to practice qualitative coding and explore segmentation, codebook development, and inter-coder agreement.

GOT.scripts.final.coded.major.characters042219s1ep1to3.csv	Coded dataset including dialogue segments from the same episodes, coded for interactions among major characters. This file is used for demonstration and ENA modelling.

GoT_codebook.xlsx	Codebook outlining the categories and definitions used for the example datasets.

**Learning Objectives**
Participants will learn to:

  1.Understand the conceptual foundations of Quantitative Ethnography and Epistemic Network Analysis.

  2.Segment and code qualitative data to create structured datasets.

  3.Train automated coding using nCoder.

  4.Visualise and interpret epistemic networks to identify meaningful connections in discourse.

From Qualitative Data to Quantified Connections: An Introduction to Epistemic Network Analysis
Overview

This repository contains the materials and datasets used in the workshop “From Qualitative Data to Quantified Connections: An Introduction to Epistemic Network Analysis (ENA)”, designed to introduce researchers and educators to the principles and practice of ENA. The workshop demonstrates how qualitative discourse can be systematically coded, modelled, and visualised as a network to reveal patterns of connection in meaning and reasoning.

Contents
File	Description
GOT.scripts.final.coded.042219.csv	Example dataset of coded discourse segments used to illustrate ENA modelling.
